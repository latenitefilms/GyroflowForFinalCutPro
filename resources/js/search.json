[[{"l":"Gyroflow Toolbox","p":["Allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Apple's Final Cut Pro."]},{"i":"what-is-gyroflow","l":"What is Gyroflow?","p":["Gyroflow is a free and open source application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and Gyroflow stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).","Gyroflow Toolbox allows you to take the stabilised data from Gyroflow and use it within Final Cut Pro as an effect.","You can watch a great Gyroflow Tutorial here."]},{"l":"Prerequisites","p":["To create the Gyroflow Project (that you import into Gyroflow Toolbox), you'll need to install the latest Gyroflow application.","You don't necessarily have to install Gyroflow on the same machine as Gyroflow Toolbox - for example, you could run Gyroflow on a fast PC, then copy the exported Gyroflow Project to your Mac to import into Gyroflow Toolbox."]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["You should only ever apply the Gyroflow Toolbox effect to an entire clip- the clip cannot be trimmed. Due to limitations in Final Cut Pro's FxPlug4 API - we currently can't determine the source start timecode of a clip. Because of this, the Gyroflow Toolbox effect should only be applied to a clip where the start of the clip hasn't been trimmed in the timeline (i.e. the clip you have in the timeline should show the first frame of the source clip). If you need to trim the start of this clip, you can use the full clip within a Compound Clip, then trim the Compound Clip as required. We have been in contact with the Final Cut Pro team about this, and there's currently no other better workaround or solution. Discussed in issue 8."]},{"l":"Test Footage","p":["The Gyroflow team have kindly shared some test footage that contains gyro data on Google Drive."]},{"l":"Supported Gyro Sources","p":["Android apps: Sensor Logger, Sensor Record, OpenCamera Sensors, MotionCam Pro","ArduPilot logs (*.bin, *.log)","Betaflight blackbox (*.bfl, *.bbl, *.csv)","Blackmagic RAW (*.braw)","DJI (Avata, O3 Air Unit)","GoPro (HERO 5 and later)","Gyroflow .gcsv log","Hawkeye Firefly X Lite CSV","Insta360 (OneR, OneRS, SMO 4k, Go, GO2, Caddx Peanut)","iOS apps: Sensor Logger, G-Field Recorder, Gyro, GyroCam","KanDao (Obisidian Pro)","RED RAW (*.r3d)","Runcam CSV (Runcam 5 Orange, iFlight GOCam GR, Runcam Thumb, Mobius Maxi 4K)","Sony (a1, a7c, a7r IV, a7 IV, a7s III, a9 II, FX3, FX6, FX9, RX0 II, RX100 VII, ZV1, ZV-E10)","Vuze (VuzeXR)","WitMotion (WT901SDCL binary and *.txt)","You can find a list of all the current supported gyro sources on the Gyroflow Repository."]},{"l":"Installation","p":["You can download the latest Gyroflow Toolbox release here.","Download the top ZIP file, then when you extract it, drag the Gyroflow Toolbox.app application to your Applications folder.","You should then run the application. If it's the first time installing the software, or if there's been an update, you'll be prompted to Install Motion Template.","Screenshot","Once you click the button, you'll be prompted to grant permission to your Movies folder. This is due to macOS's sandboxing, and you'll only need to do this once. Click OK.","You then need to click Grant Access:","Once done, you'll be presented with a successful message:","The button will now be disabled, and will say Motion Template Installed. You can now close the Gyroflow Toolbox application."]},{"l":"How To Use","p":["After you have installed Gyroflow and Gyroflow Toolbox, you'll see a Gyroflow Toolbox Effect in the Effects Browser.","Because Gyroflow Toolbox has no knowledge of the clip it's been applied to, we can't automatically load the video clip into Gyroflow, so you'll need to manually import it by either dragging the file in, or clicking the Open File button.","From the Inspector you can then click Launch Gyroflow, to open the Gyroflow application.","Gyroflow Toolbox also has some limitations with certain footage - for example, currently with the RED Komodo, you'll need to transcode the footage to ProRes, load the ProRes in Gyroflow then load your original .R3D in the Motion data section of Gyroflow.","It's important that you include the processed gyro data, otherwise none of the stabilisation will come across to Gyroflow Toolbox, and you'll get an error message when attempting to import it.","Lens profile and Motion data files are automatically detected for some cameras (such as GoPro's). Otherwise search for the correct lens profile and open the Motion data file.","Once you have finished stabilising in Gyroflow you should click the Export button arrow and then Export project file (including processed gyro data).","Screenshot","The data from the Gyroflow Project gets saved within the Final Cut Pro library. If you want to reload it, you can either re-import, or if the file is in the same path, you can press Reload Project.","The Gyroflow Discord is also very active and a great way to get fast support.","You can adjust and keyframe the FOV, Smoothness and Lens Correction within Final Cut Pro.","You can also experiment with the stabilisation options and algorithms. They all give different \"looks\" for the final result.","You can learn more about Gyroflow here.","You can now press the Import Project button in the Final Cut Pro Inspector to import it.","You can then apply this effect to any clips that are supported by Gyroflow.","You should play the video to check if additional synchronisation is required. If so, right-click on the timeline and select Auto sync here at at least two points of the video where some motion is present. This synchronises the gyro data and the video."]},{"i":"help--support","l":"Help & Support","p":["For general support and discussion, you can find the Gyroflow developers and other users on the Gyroflow Discord server.","For bug reports and feature requests for Gyroflow Toolbox, please submit an issue."]},{"l":"Credits","p":["This repository was thrown together by Chris Hocking.","However, none of this would be possible without the incredible Gyroflow project and the incredibly help and support from their main developer, AdrianEddy.","The Gyroflow Toolbox icon was designed by the amazing Matthew Skiles."]},{"l":"License","p":["All the code within this repository is licensed under MIT.","However, as soon as you build/compile the Rust code, it uses gyroflow_core as a dependancy, which uses the GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception.","This means that as soon as you build/compile Gyroflow Toolbox, the application falls under the same GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception license.","Because of this, all Releases in this repository also fall under the same GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception."]}],[{"l":"LICENSE","p":["MIT License","Copyright (c) 2022 Chris Hocking.","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
