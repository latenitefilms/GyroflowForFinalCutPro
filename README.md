# Gyroflow for Final Cut Pro

Allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Apple's Final Cut Pro.

This is currently very much a work-in-progress proof-of-concept, and not ready for end-users.

This repository only contains the FxPlug4 code. All the real magic happens in the main [Gyroflow Repo](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow).
