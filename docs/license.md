**However**, as soon as you build/compile the Rust code, it uses [`gyroflow_core`](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/tree/master/src/core) as a dependancy, which uses the [GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/LICENSE).

This means that as soon as you build/compile Gyroflow Toolbox, the application falls under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

Because of this, all [Releases](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox/releases) in this repository also fall under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/LICENSE).
