This means that as soon as you build/compile Gyroflow Toolbox, the application falls under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/LICENSE){target="_blank"} license.

Because of this, any time you build the code in this repository, the binary will also fall under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0 with App Store Exception](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/blob/master/LICENSE){target="_blank"}.
