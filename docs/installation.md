# Installation

You can download the latest Gyroflow Toolbox release [here](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox/releases/latest).

Download the top ZIP file, then when you extract it, drag the `Gyroflow Toolbox.app` application to your Applications folder.

You should then run the application. If it's the first time installing the software, or if there's been an update, you'll be prompted to **Install Motion Template**.

Once you click the button, you'll be prompted to grant permission to your Movies folder. This is due to macOS's sandboxing, and you'll only need to do this once. Click **OK**.

You then need to click **Grant Access**:

Once done, you'll be presented with a successful message:

The button will now be disabled, and will say **Motion Template Installed**. You can now close the Gyroflow Toolbox application.
