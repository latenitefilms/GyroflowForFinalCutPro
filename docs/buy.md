This is generally **9.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD9.99**, **USD9.99**, **CAD9.99**).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 9.99 (i.e. Rp 169,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a **USD$9.99 equivalent** (calculated by Apple).

There is currently no free trial, and it is only be available on the Mac App Store as a **one-time payment**.

Alternatively, as Gyroflow Toolbox is **open source**, you can also [build it yourself via GitHub](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox).
