**Gyroflow Toolbox** is not currently compatible with **Gyroflow v1.5.1** or later.<br />
<br />
We are actively working on a new version of Gyroflow Toolbox to add support for the latest Gyroflow improvements.<br />
<br />
In the meantime you can download and use **Gyroflow v1.5.0** [here](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/releases/tag/v1.5.0){target="_blank"}.
!!!

**Gyroflow Toolbox** is a one-time payment of **4.99**.

This is generally **4.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD4.99**, **USD4.99**, **CAD4.99**).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a **USD$4.99 equivalent**.

There is currently no free trial, and it is only be available on the Mac App Store as a **one-time payment**.

You can find information about Educational Pricing [here](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io/educational/).

Alternatively, as Gyroflow Toolbox is **open source**, you can also [build it yourself via GitHub](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox).
