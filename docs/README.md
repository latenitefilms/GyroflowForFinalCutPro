# Gyroflow Toolbox

Allows you to import [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) Projects into Apple's [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/).

_**Advanced gyro-based video stabilisation without the round-tripping!**_

You can even use this in conjunction with [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io) (also on the Mac App Store), to stabilise **Blackmagic RAW files**!

To get started, simply drop your video clip from the Final Cut Pro Browser or Finder to the drop zone in the Final Cut Pro Inspector. You can also drop a Gyroflow Project.

**Sony**, **GoPro (Hero 8+)**, **DJI**, **Blackmagic RAW** and **Insta360** will be automatically synced when imported. Other cameras, such as **RED**, will require launching Gyroflow to synchronise.

**GoPro**, **DJI** and **Insta360** will automatically select a Lens Profile. For all other cameras, you may need to manually select a Lens Profile, however, we'll try and GUESS a good match.

### What is Gyroflow?

[Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) is a free and open source third-party application that can stabilise your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and accelerometer.

Many modern cameras now record that gyroscope data internally (such as Blackmagic, GoPro, Sony, Insta360 and others), and [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) stabilises the captured footage precisely by using that data.

[Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) can also use gyroscope data from an external source, such as Betaflight Blackbox.

**Gyroflow Toolbox** allows you to take the stabilised data from [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) and use it within Final Cut Pro as an effect, so you don't have to export a ProRes from [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz)!

Here's some great videos on YouTube that demonstrate how [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) works:

[Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz) has [fantastic documentation](https://docs.gyroflow.xyz/app/) that is regularly updated.
