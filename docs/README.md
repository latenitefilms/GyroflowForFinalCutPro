### What is Gyroflow?

[Gyroflow](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow){target="_blank"} is a free and open source application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and Gyroflow stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

Gyroflow Toolbox allows you to take the stabilised data from Gyroflow and use it within Final Cut Pro as an effect.

You can watch a great Gyroflow Tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAds3x8UU1w){target="_blank"}.
